                2.1. Camera Studio (“Camera Studio”) provides a document camera application designed for Chrome OS,
                allowing users to capture, display, and potentially save images and video feeds (the "Services"). The
                Services may include features that allow you to save content to your local device or to third-party
                cloud storage services like Google Drive, subject to your authorization. Camera Studio also offers
                features like zoom, rotation, mirroring, freezing, and drawing tools (the "Services"), all optimized for
                ease of use in both online and offline environments. In addition, feedback can be submitted directly
                through the application, and the app is accessible without requiring login unless cloud storage features
                are used.
